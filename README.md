---

## 🌟 Overview

**FlowShift** is a mindful digital companion designed to gently disrupt negative digital habits and reclaim user attention — not by blocking, but by introducing meaningful, well-timed interventions. Built as a mobile app, FlowShift fits naturally into daily routines, nudging users toward awareness, balance, and reflection without being intrusive.
